## Game Overview
>In REEFSCAPE presented by Haas, two competing alliances are invited to score coral, harvest algae, and
attach to the barge before time runs out. Alliances earn additional rewards for meeting specific scoring
thresholds and for cooperating with their opponents.
>  
>During the first 15 seconds of the match, robots are autonomous. Without guidance from their drivers, robots
leave their starting zone, score coral on the reef, harvest algae from the reef, and collect and score additional
coral.
>
>During the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds, drivers control their robots. Robots collect coral from human
players at their coral station and score them on the reef. To unlock all scoring locations on the reef, robots
must dislodge algae from the reef and either score it in the barge or deliver it to the human player through the
processor.
>
>A human player can then deliver the algae to the barge. If at least two algae are scored in the processor by
each alliance, both alliances earn a Coopertition Point (which influences their rank in the tournament) and
lowers the requirements for a ranking point.
>
>As time runs out, robots prepare to return to the surface with their algae by grabbing onto their cages and
parking under the barge.
>
>The alliance that earns the most points wins the match!
